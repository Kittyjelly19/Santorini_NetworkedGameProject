# Santorini_NetworkedGameProject

University project for networking and multiplayer module. 
The idea was to create a basic networked turn based game using the game template given by our tutor. 

Task:
Add networked multiplayer functionallity to the game so that it can be played by 2-4 players. Consider cheating prevention and security in your development.

Current functionality as of 02/12/2020:
This assignment has already been sumbmitted, however, I plan on going back to it to add additional functionality. At present, the server can accept any number of clients successfully, and each client launches an independant instance of the game once connected to the server.
